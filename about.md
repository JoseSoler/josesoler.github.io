Who am I?

I'm an experienced Java Spring ecosystem Software Engineer with 13+ years of experience in the IT, currently working in the Health Informatics Field, implementing Microservices and doing DevOps tasks with Docker while trying to get into the field of BigData and NoSQL.

Please notice that this site is fresh new and under skeleton construction. I hope to start adding (hopefully interesting) post entries in the coming weeks.

You can check out my CV at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseluisoler/)

By the way, just in case you wonder, YASEB stands for Yet Another Software Engineering Blog.

Thank you for landing into my site !
